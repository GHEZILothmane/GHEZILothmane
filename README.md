# GHEZILothmane
Hello, I am GHEZIL Othmane a Software Engineer & web developer. I am involved in Web Development. Thereâ€™s nothing I enjoy more than playing with codes and designs (even though I am not a designer but I love to be), searching, learning new things, solving errors, helping others. I'm a positive person, naturally curious, and hard-working to improve my technical and soft skills. Got any questions? Contact me.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as Full-Stack Web IA Developer.
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m interested Java Scripts related concepts (Deep Dive into JavaScript) and its framework mainly React Js.
ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Web/AI posts.
ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything, I'll be happy to help and share :D.

âš¡ Beside Coding Life: Cooking, House Working, organizing events, managing Fb pages and groups, discovering new cultures and languages, reading books, singing at Sumle, handcrafting or drawing, and sometimes writing stories and poems.
